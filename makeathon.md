## Overview

We organize free events for high schoolers within driving distance of Boston, with two goals in mind:

1. Helping students make media projects that explain STEM topics to various audiences
2. Helping students meet people in careers connecting STEM, society, and the public

Hands-on activities are the most direct way for students to understand the challenges and rewards of making STEM accessible and interesting. More importantly, it empowers them to approach, understand, and even teach difficult topics in any context.

## Past Sponsors

Our events wouldn't be possible without the generosity of our supporters. We've received sponsorship from Science in the News and the Harvard/MIT COOP, as well as donations from Nathan Sanders and Jeff DelViscio.
