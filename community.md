# In the Community

Although there are thousands of STEM programs and activities for high school students, there are few, if any, that **focus** on science communication and the interdisciplinary aspects of STEM.

**In the science communication world, high school-aged creators and practitioners are unheard of**. Many professionals currently in interdisciplinary STEM jobs only learned about the field in graduate school or while already in the workforce.

As a uniquely youth-led organization bringing the skills and perspectives of science communication to a new demographic, Science & Us strives to engage with the broader community. We aim to learn from others and share our experiences with the goal of ultimately shifting the public perception of science.

"[ComSciCon](https://comscicon.com/) is a series of workshops focused on the communication of complex and technical concepts organized by graduate students, for graduate students.  ComSciCon attendees meet and interact with professional communicators, build lasting networks with graduate students in all fields of science and engineering from around the country, and write and publish original works."

Of about 800 applicants, 50 graduate students from the United States and Canada were accepted to participate in ComSciCon, with travel and lodging completely covered. **Science & Us founder Katherine Huang was one of a limited number of Invited Guests.**

At ComSciCon, Katherine excitedly engaged with fellow attendees and formed ideas on how to improve Science & Us. Two of Katherine's favorite things she learned about are [The Story Collider](https://www.storycollider.org/) and [Massive Science](https://massivesci.com/), whose founders (Liz Neeley and Nadja Oertelt, respectively) both spoke at or participated in a panel at ComSciCon.

### Science Media Awards and Summit in the Hub 2018 (SMASH18)

[SMASH18](https://www.sciencemediasummit.org/) is a biennial, 3-day event by Jackson Hole WILD and WGBH. "September 25-27, 2018, more than 300 science media stakeholders will gather to celebrate exceptional media, cutting-edge discoveries and explore new ways of communicating the wonders of science to a global audience in a rapidly-changing media landscape." On the final day of SMASH, the recipients of the [Science Media Awards](https://www.sciencemediasummit.org/2018-categories.html) are announced.

**Science & Us leaders Sasha Hussain and Katherine Huang will be attending SMASH18 as [High School Scholars](https://www.sciencemediasummit.org/2018-fellows.html) and potentially participating in programming focused on youth involvement in science media.**
