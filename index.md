## Our Mission

Whether you love art, astrophysics, or anything in between, science impacts your life and the issues you care about. That means we need a better bridge between science… and *us*. **Science and Us** is a youth-led nonprofit dedicated to building that bridge.

## Join us at our Makeathon

We organize a hands-on Makeathon for high schoolers to create media projects explaining STEM topics to various audiences. We invite awesome, down-to-earth experts who show that it's possible to build a unique, fulfilling career from a range of interests.

**Our Makeathon is Saturday, August 17, 2019 at MIT. Apply today! All we're looking for is a willingness to learn. (You don't need to be a "science person!")**

<a href="makeathon" class="button button-primary">Apply Today</a>

Empowering youth to approach and solve the world's interdisciplinary problems is only possible through the generosity of our sponsors. If you want to inspire the next generation, we'd love to talk to you.

## Finding your place in STEM shouldn't be left to chance

Today, people connecting science and society are the ones who will change the world. Unfortunately, most students aren't aware of opportunities in science policy, media, education, and more—or how to pursue them. That knowledge changes lives, and we wholeheartedly believe it should be accessible to everyone.

We're writing a book called **Stories of Science and Us**, a collection of honest, personal journeys and advice from diverse people bridging science and the public. We plan to share **Stories** with classrooms across the country. Now is your chance to play a key role in its development—let us know what you're looking for, or volunteer to be interviewed for the book!

More information coming soon!
