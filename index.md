# Join the Science and Us Community

We're gathering students curious about science communication—making complex topics engaging and accessible to the public—and willing to step outside their comfort zone.

Each month, our team releases a theme for you to make a project about, either on your own or with others. All sorts of formats are welcome: videos, art, articles, and more! In addition to fun events (movie nights, music sessions) with students from all over, you'll get resources like recognition and feedback from professional science journalists, artists, and other experts.

# Makeathons

We've organized four events at MIT, Harvard, and Boston University. At our Makeathons, high schoolers make videos, podcasts, infographics, and other projects explaining technical topics to the public. We invite science journalists, museum exhibit designers, space librarians, medical illustrators, and other awesome, interdisciplinary folks to teach hands-on workshops and share their stories with attendees.

All students are welcome, especially those who aren't interested in traditional STEM activities and careers.
