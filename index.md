## Our Mission

Whether you love art, astrophysics, or anything in between, science impacts your life and the issues you care about. That means we need a better bridge between science… and *us*. **Science and Us** is a youth-led nonprofit dedicated to building that bridge. [Learn more](/about)

## Join us at our Makeathon

On August 17, 2019, at MIT, we're hosting a free Makeathon for middle and high school students from any school.

We invite awesome, down-to-earth experts to help you create articles, podcasts, and art communicating STEM topics. By the end of the day, you'll have a cool project to take home, plus a couple new friends (not to take home).

Did we mention? There's also free food!

## Stories of Science and Us

Today, people connecting science and society are the ones who will change the world. Unfortunately, most students aren't aware of opportunities in science policy, media, education, and more—or how to pursue them. That knowledge changes lives, and we wholeheartedly believe it should be accessible to everyone.

We're writing a book called **Stories of Science and Us**, a collection of honest, personal journeys and advice from diverse people bridging science and the public. We plan to share **Stories** with classrooms across the country. Now is your chance to play a key role in its development—let us know what you're looking for, or volunteer to be interviewed for the book!
