# Join the Science and Us Community

The Science and Us Community is an online community of students curious about making complex topics engaging and accessible to the public and willing to step outside their comfort zone. In June, our team released a prompt for our community members to make projects about. The projects can be found [here](/community/#project-gallery).

We welcome all students interested in using creative approaches and any kinds of media to communicate complex topics.

# Makeathons

We've organized four events at MIT, Harvard, and Boston University. At our Makeathons, high schoolers make videos, podcasts, infographics, and other projects explaining technical topics to the public. We invite science journalists, museum exhibit designers, space librarians, medical illustrators, and other awesome, interdisciplinary folks to teach hands-on workshops and share their stories with attendees.

All students are welcome, especially those who aren't interested in traditional STEM activities and careers.
