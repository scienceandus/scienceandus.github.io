					<h2>Making the complex compelling</h2>

					<p><p>Net neutrality, environmental pollution, social media privacy—all those issues involve science, and affect much more than just scientists.</p>
<p>Understanding the fundamentals of STEM is crucial, yet many view it as intimidating or irrelevant. <b>Science communication—explaining complex topics in engaging, clear ways</b>—can bridge this gap.</p>
<p class="highlight">Science & Us enables STEM-oriented students to better explain their passions to non-experts, and teaches them about interdisciplinary careers, like science media and policy, that are rarely mentioned in school.</p>

					<h2>Summer 2018 Workshop</h2>
					<p><p>In June, we held an event at the Boston University Metcalf Science Center for 40 high school students. Invited guests from Harvard, MIT, Tufts, Boston University, and STAT taught the students about:</p> <ul>
	<li>Using social media and podcasts for #scicomm</li>
	<li>Making presentations, graphics, and explanations clear and interesting to different audiences</li>
	<li>Day-to-day activities of a space librarian, science diplomat, and more!</li>

					<h2>Winter 2018 Workshop</h2>
					<p><p>This winter, we're introducing a new model that emphasizes giving students <b>opportunities to create their own science communication pieces, learn by doing, and deepen their understanding of a topic of interest</b>.</p>
<p>Before the event, accepted participants will draft the beginnings of their work, whether it's the first paragraph of an article, storyboard sketches of a video, or another medium. Our workshop will have sessions, led by practitioners and experts in various fields, to help students develop and ultimately share their work.</p>

          <p>Professor Paul Arthur Berkman is building connections between science, diplomacy and information technology to promote cooperation and prevent discord, balancing national interests and common interests for the benefit of all on Earth. He was a visiting professor at the University of California at the age of 23, after wintering the previous year in Antarctica on a SCUBA research expedition, evolving two decades later into a textbook on Science Into Policy. He was a Fulbright Distinguished and Head of the Arctic Ocean Geopolitics Programme at the University of Cambridge, chairing the Antarctic Treaty Summit at the Smithsonian Institution in 2009 with legacy through the first book on Science Diplomacy and then the first formal NATO-Russia dialogue the following year regarding Environmental Security in the Arctic Ocean with legacy contributions through a successful Springer publication of the same name. He currently coordinates the Arctic Options and Pan-Arctic Options projects (involving support from national science agencies in the United States, Russian Federation, Norway, France, China and Canada from 2013-2020) as well as a Carnegie Corporation project on US- Russia Relations. In September 2015, he joined the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University as Professor of Practice in Science Diplomacy and is now Director of the Science Diplomacy Center as a university-wide initiative. For his interdisciplinary research and publications, including the November 2017 policy forum published in Science on Arctic Science Agreement Propels Science Diplomacy, as well as other contributions, Prof. Berkman has received many awards nationally and internationally, most recently the Vernadsky Medal from the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences in 2017. Paul is happily married with two daughters.</p>

          <p>Mariah Tinger’s fascination with nature began with catching polliwogs as a kid; exploring Yosemite National Park’s granite domes and chasing bears out of its campgrounds fortified her love of outdoor adventure. Her career is now firmly established in teaching the critical principles of maintaining a sustainable planet as our home. Mariah’s main educational mediums are sustainability courses at Boston University’s Questrom School of Business, as a co-host of The Climate Minute – a podcast through Massachusetts Climate Action Network, and through her book Protecting the Planet: Environmental Champions from Conservation to Climate Change. She also offers sustainability consulting services to businesses near her home on the North Shore of Massachusetts.
