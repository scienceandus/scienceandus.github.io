## Next steps

The goal of *Stories of Science and Us* is to help people, and we're grateful for your input. Our book is coming out in September. In the meantime, feel free to share the [input form](https://scienceandus.org/stories) with others, and contribute to our Indiegogo campaign to fund the book. Thanks so much! We couldn't do this without you.
