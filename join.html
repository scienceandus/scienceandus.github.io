    <h2>Join Our Team</h2>
    <p>We believe that being able to make science clear and engaging empowers us to solve problems in any field.</p>
    <p>We believe that making science communication more prevalent helps build a culture where we can be fully ourselvesâ€”no more pressure to conform to labels like "STEM person" or "humanities person."</p>
    <h4>Yet, science communication is rarely mentioned in classrooms. That's why we run events and create online resources to help high schoolers learn it.</h4>
    <p>As a member of our tight-knit team, you'll be able to make a significant impact on students and our organization. We strive to communicate authentically and support each other's growth.</p>
    <p>We review applications on a rolling basis and will follow up with you within one week of receiving your application.</p>
