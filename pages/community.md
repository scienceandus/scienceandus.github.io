### The Science and Us Community is a Discord community of students curious about science communication—making complex topics engaging and accessible to the public—and willing to step outside their comfort zone.

During our online events, our team releases a theme for you to make a project about, either on your own or with others. All sorts of formats are welcome: videos, art, articles, and more! In addition to fun activities (movie nights, music sessions) with students from all over, you'll get resources like recognition and feedback from professional science journalists, artists, and other experts.
