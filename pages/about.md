### Science and Us is a student-led organization introducing teens to science communication, media, policy, and related fields. We help students understand and explain topics in any field, and empower them to break out of labels like "STEM person" and "humanities person."

We host one-day Makeathons where high schoolers create projects that explain technical topics to the public. We invite people like museum exhibit designers, podcasters, policymakers, comic illustrators, and researchers to give hands-on workshops and share their stories during panels.

As the only (as far as we know) science communication nonprofit for and by students, we enjoy sharing our experiences with the broader community and learning from others. We've attended or presented at [Science Talk](https://www.sciencetalk.org/), [ComSciCon](https://comscicon.com/), [Science Media Summit](https://www.sciencemediasummit.org/), and [Global Community Bio Summit](https://www.biosummit.org/).

Our Makeathons have been graciously supported by the [Broadcom Foundation](http://broadcomfoundation.org/), [AI4ALL](https://ai-4-all.org/), [Communicating Science at MIT](https://communicatingsciencemit.wordpress.com/), [Science in the News](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/), Boston University, and the [National Science Communication Institute](http://sciencecommunication.institute/).
