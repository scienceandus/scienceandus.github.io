				<h2>About Science and Us</h2>

				<p>We're a student-led nonprofit that runs events and creates online resources to help high schoolers learn science communication, a field that bridges science with the public.</p>

				<p>We know what it's like to feel intimidated by science, or to love science but have no other like-minded people around you. <b>We believe that science communication is key to building a culture where we can be fully ourselves, and be better equipped to collaborate and solve the world's pressing problems.</b> <!--<a href="/about">Meet the team →</a>--></p>

					<p>We hold events for high school students to create science communication projects over the course of a day. Invited experts run hands-on workshops like cartoon illustration, podcasting, and stop motion animation. Students meet and chat with awesome people from science journalism, museum exhibit design, climate policy, and beyond.</p>
