        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Whether you love art, astrophysics, or anything in between, science impacts your life and the issues you care about. That means we need a better bridge between science… and <i>us</i>. Science and Us is a youth-led nonprofit dedicated to building that bridge.</p>

        <h2>Join us at our Makeathons</h2>
        
        <p>We organize hands-on Makeathons where high schoolers create media projects that explain STEM topics to various audiences. We invite awesome, down-to-earth experts who show that it’s possible build a fulfilling, unique career from a range of interests.</p>

        <p><b>Our next Makeathon is on Saturday, August 17, 2019, at MIT—apply today! All we’re looking for is a willingness to learn. (You don’t need to be a “science person!”)</b></p>

        <a href="makeathon" class="button button-primary">Apply Today</a>

        <p>Empowering youth to approach, understand, and solve interdisciplinary problems, including the world’s biggest challenges, is only possible through the generosity of sponsors. If your organization wants to inspire the next generation, we’d love to talk to you.</p>

        <h2>Finding your place in STEM shouldn't be left to chance</h2>

        <p>Today, people connecting science and society—through science policy, illustration, journalism, education, and more—are the ones who will change the world. However, the vast majority of students aren’t aware of these opportunities, or how to reach them. That knowledge positively changes students’ lives, and we wholeheartedly believe it should be accessible to everyone.</p>

        <p>We’re currently working on a book called Stories of Science and Us, a collection of honest, personal journeys and advice from diverse people bridging science and society. We aim to distribute Stories to classrooms, organizations, and youth across the country. Now is your chance to play a key role in the development of Stories—let us know what you’re looking for, or volunteer to be interviewed for the book!</p>

        <p>More information coming soon!</p>
