					<h2>About Science and Us</h2>
					<p>We're a student-led nonprofit that runs events and creates online resources to help high schoolers learn science communication, a field that bridges science with the public.</p>
					<p>We know what it's like to feel intimidated by science, or to love science but have no other like-minded people around you. <b>We believe that science communication is key to building a culture where we can be fully ourselves, and be better equipped to collaborate and solve the world's pressing problems.</b></p>
					<br/>
					<p>Founded in February 2018, we've held events at Boston University, Harvard University, and MIT, and have invited 30+ panelists and workshop leaders who are policymakers, podcast producers, professors, comic book illustrators, space librarians, journalists, and more.</p>
					<p><b>We've been featured in <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2019/11/11/opinion/choose-one/">The Boston Globe</a></b> and <a href="https://www.lowellsun.com/2018/07/24/huang-stirs-change-by-making-science-and-humanities-work-together-video/">local news</a>. We've presented at <a href="https://www.sciencetalk.org/">Science Talk</a>, <a href="https://txyb.org/">TEDxYouth@BeaconStreet</a>, <a href="https://www.biosummit.org/">the Global Community Bio Summit</a>, and <a href="https://www.hubweek.org/">HUBweek</a>.</p>
